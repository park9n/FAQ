### What is difference between job and workspace?
If you are not using workflows, the jobs map must contain a job named build.
This build job is the default entry-point for a run that is triggered by a push to your VCS provider.
It is possible to then specify additional jobs and run them using the CircleCI API.

No, workflows run only. If you are not using workflows, the jobs map must contain a job named build. This build job is the default entry-point for a run that is triggered by a push to your VCS provider.
